Application writen in **Python 3** using the library **Pillow**.

![](./demo/PySpriter.png)

The main idea of this application is: 
  1. Load one or more animations with a high volume of frames and help reducing it without losing animation quality.
  2. Help reducing size of the images without losing quality.
  3. Convert many png files into a sprite sheet and vice versa.
  4. Change the resolution of the sprite.
